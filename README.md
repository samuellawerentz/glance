# Glance

Self-hostable static-file hosting on Cloudflare's free tier. Drop a folder of HTML/markdown/assets → get a URL.

Cloudflare Workers + Hono · React + React Router v7 · D1 · R2 · KV. $0/month.

## Quick deploy

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/plivo/glance)

The button forks the repo and provisions the D1 / KV / R2 bindings on your account. Then, from
your clone, finish setup in one shot:

```bash
bun install
scripts/setup.sh   # generates secrets + a one-time admin token, migrates, deploys, prints the URL
```

`setup.sh` prints a **bootstrap token** at the end. Open the printed `/login`, paste the token into
**Complete setup**, and you become the first superadmin — **no Google account required**. Google
SSO is an optional upgrade you can wire up later (see [Deploy](#deploy)). Prefer to do it by hand?
The manual path below still works.

## Layout

```
packages/api   Hono Worker — /api/* + file serving, ships the React app as static assets
packages/web   Vite + React + React Router v7 (data mode, no useEffect)
packages/cli   `glance` CLI (Bun)
```

## Local dev

```bash
bun install
cp packages/api/.dev.vars.example packages/api/.dev.vars   # set SESSION_SECRET + BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN (Google optional)
bun run db:migrate:local              # apply D1 migrations to the local dev db
bun run build:web                     # build the SPA the worker serves
bun run dev                           # main worker (8787) + content worker (8788) + vite (5173)
```

Open http://localhost:5173.

## Cloudflare provisioning (one-time, fresh account)

```bash
wrangler login

# D1 database
wrangler d1 create glance-db
# → outputs: database_id = "xxxxxxxx-…"

# KV namespace for sessions
wrangler kv namespace create GLANCE_SESSIONS
# → outputs: id = "yyyyyyyy…"

# R2 bucket — enable R2 in the Cloudflare dashboard first, then:
wrangler r2 bucket create glance-files
```

Paste the IDs into **both** `packages/api/wrangler.jsonc` and `packages/api/wrangler.content.jsonc`
(they ship with `YOUR_*` placeholders):

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc  (and wrangler.content.jsonc — same fields)
"d1_databases": [{ "database_id": "<paste database_id here>" }],
"kv_namespaces": [{ "id": "<paste kv id here>" }],
```

`account_id` is resolved automatically from `wrangler login`; you can remove it or leave the placeholder.

Then set the `vars` block in both configs to your real values:

| var | example |
|---|---|
| `APP_URL` | `https://glance.your-subdomain.workers.dev` |
| `CONTENT_URL` | `https://glance-content.your-subdomain.workers.dev` |
| `ALLOWED_HD` | `yourcompany.com` (Google Workspace domain) |
| `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` | `you@yourcompany.com` |

Also update `_headers` `frame-src` and the content worker `frame-ancestors` to the real `CONTENT_URL`.

Finally apply migrations to the remote D1:

```bash
cd packages/api
wrangler d1 migrations apply glance-db --remote
```

## Deploy

The fastest path is `scripts/setup.sh` (see [Quick deploy](#quick-deploy)). It generates the
secrets, sets a one-time `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`, runs the remote migration, deploys both workers, wires
the live `workers.dev` URLs into config, and prints the first-run link + token. It is idempotent:
re-running never rotates an existing `SESSION_SECRET` (which would drop live sessions). The manual
equivalent is below.

### 1. Secrets

Both workers need `SESSION_SECRET` and `CONTENT_TOKEN_SECRET`. The main worker also needs a
`BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` for first-run admin setup.

```bash
cd packages/api

# Generate secrets: openssl rand -hex 32
for w in "" "--config wrangler.content.jsonc"; do
  echo "$SESSION_SECRET"        | wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET        $w
  echo "$CONTENT_TOKEN_SECRET"  | wrangler secret put CONTENT_TOKEN_SECRET  $w
done

# First-run admin gate (paste this into /login → Complete setup). Keep it secret.
echo "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" | wrangler secret put BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN
```

`SESSION_SECRET` — HMAC key for signed cookies and KV session tokens.
`CONTENT_TOKEN_SECRET` — separate HMAC key used to sign short-lived gated-content URL tokens.
Keep them distinct.

### 2. Ship

```bash
bun run deploy   # build web → deploy main worker (with assets) → deploy content worker
```

### 3. First run (bootstrap the admin)

Open `https://glance.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/login`, paste your `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` into the
**Complete setup** field, and submit. This claims `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` as the first superadmin and
signs you in — no Google account, no seed script. Once an admin exists the setup panel disappears
and the token is inert.

### Google OAuth (optional)

Glance runs fine on bootstrap auth alone. To add Google Workspace SSO later, create an OAuth client
at console.cloud.google.com → Credentials (authorized redirect URI
`https://glance.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/api/auth/callback`), then set the credentials and
redeploy:

```bash
cd packages/api
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
bun run deploy
```

The login page shows the Google button automatically once both credentials are set. A later Google
login on the same email backfills onto your bootstrap admin (the role is preserved). While the
credentials are unset, the Google routes return 404 and the button is hidden.

## CLI

The `glance` CLI uploads local folders straight from the terminal.

### Install

```bash
# one-liner — downloads the standalone binary for your platform (no Bun/Node needed)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuellawerentz/glance/main/install.sh | sh
```

It installs to `~/.local/bin/glance`. Override the target with `GLANCE_INSTALL_DIR`.

From a clone instead:

```bash
cd packages/cli
bun link          # makes `glance` available globally via bun's bin linking
# or
bun install -g .
```

### Commands

```
glance login
glance deploy <path> --space <slug> --name <slug> [--visibility team|public|private|group]
glance list
glance delete <space/slug>
glance logout
```

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `login` | device-code flow — opens a browser, polls until approved, saves token to `~/.glance/config.json` |
| `deploy <path>` | uploads all files in `<path>` (walks recursively, skips `.git`/`node_modules`) |
| `list` | shows your sites with visibility and URL |
| `delete <space/slug>` | prompts for confirmation, then deletes |
| `logout` | revokes the server-side session and removes the local token |

**deploy flags**

| flag | required | default |
|---|---|---|
| `--space <slug>` | yes | — |
| `--name <slug>` | yes | — |
| `--visibility` | no | `team` |

Visibility values: `team` · `public` · `private` · `group`.

### Pointing the CLI at a self-hosted instance

```bash
GLANCE_API_URL=https://glance.your-subdomain.workers.dev glance login
```

The env var is read on every command; set it in your shell profile to make it permanent.

## Security / trust model

- **Uploaded HTML/JS is untrusted.** It is served from a separate content origin (`CONTENT_URL`)
  so no session cookies from the main app ever reach it. Self-hosters are serving arbitrary
  user-supplied HTML — treat the content origin as a sandboxed domain.
- **Gated links** carry short-lived HMAC tokens signed with `CONTENT_TOKEN_SECRET`.
  Tokens are single-use and expire; the content worker verifies the signature before serving.
- **Markdown** is rendered with raw HTML neutralized and a strict `Content-Security-Policy`
  applied, so injected `<script>` tags in markdown source are inert.
- The main worker sets `frame-src` in `_headers` to `CONTENT_URL` only, so the content
  iframe cannot be substituted by an attacker-controlled origin.
